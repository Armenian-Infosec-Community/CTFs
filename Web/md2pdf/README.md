A Flask-based Markdown to PDF conversion application that allows to easily and rapidly generate nice looking PDF files.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  This challenge was inspired by the TryHackMe room (https://tryhackme.com/room/md2pdf). But still remains an actual ewal-workd scenario.

## Setup

Simply run the command below:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

or

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

## After setup

You'll find the application at http://localhost:8080, though it is still under cunstruction :)

## Goal

Investigate, research, exploit and eventually find the flag!

*Flag Format:* FLAG{...}
